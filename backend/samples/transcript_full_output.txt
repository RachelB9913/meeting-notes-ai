  "transcript": "[00:00] Sarah: Hi everyone, thanks for joining. Let’s start the weekly planning meeting. We have John Miller from product, Emily Chen from engineering, David Brown from marketing, and myself, Sarah Thompson, as the team lead.\n[00:18] John: The goal today is to review last week’s progress, make a few decisions about priorities, and assign concrete action items with owners and deadlines.\n[00:32] Emily: From the engineering side, the new reporting feature is complete and deployed to staging. We also fixed the performance issue that was affecting large customer accounts.\n[00:48] David: On the marketing side, the campaign draft is ready. We just need final confirmation on the launch date so we can coordinate ads and email communication.\n[01:05] Sarah: Great. Let’s move on to decisions. First decision: we will officially launch the new reporting feature on February 1st, assuming no critical bugs are found.\n[01:22] John: Second decision: we are prioritizing performance improvements over new feature development for the next two weeks.\n[01:35] Sarah: Third decision: the initial launch will target existing customers only, and we will open it to new users in a later phase.\n[01:52] Emily: That works for engineering. With that in mind, we should clearly define tasks.\n[02:00] Sarah: Agreed. Let’s go through action items. Emily, you will run final regression tests on the reporting feature and confirm production readiness by January 28th. Priority is high.\n[02:18] Emily: Noted. I’ll handle that and update everyone once it’s done.\n[02:25] Sarah: John, you will prepare the internal product announcement and release notes by January 29th. Priority is medium.\n[02:38] John: Sounds good, I’ll draft it and share it for review.\n[02:45] Sarah: David, you will finalize the marketing campaign assets and schedule them for the February 1st launch. Priority is high.\n[02:58] David: Understood. I’ll make sure everything is ready on time.\n[03:05] Sarah: I’ll take ownership of coordinating the launch checklist and running the go-live meeting on February 1st. Priority is high.\n[03:18] John: One more note, we should track post-launch feedback closely during the first week.\n[03:28] Sarah: Good point. Let’s consider that part of the launch coordination. Any other comments before we wrap up?\n[03:40] Emily: Nothing else from me.\n[03:42] David: All good here.\n[03:45] Sarah: Perfect. To summarize, we have a confirmed launch date, clear priorities, and assigned action items with owners and deadlines. Thanks everyone, meeting adjourned."
