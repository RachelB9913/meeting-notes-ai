  "transcript": "[00:00] John: So yeah, let’s start… um, not sure if everyone saw the email.\n[00:07] Emily: Which email?\n[00:09] John: The one about the client feedback. Basically they weren’t happy with the last delivery.\n[00:18] Mark: Was that because of the delay or the missing features?\n[00:22] Emily: I think both. The timeline slipped and expectations weren’t clear.\n[00:30] John: Right. So, we probably need to fix communication. And also review how we estimate timelines.\n[00:42] Mark: Maybe we should add buffer time. We always underestimate.\n[00:47] Emily: Agreed.\n[00:50] John: Ok, so… yeah. Let’s do something about that.\n[01:00] Mark: Should someone own this?\n[01:03] John: Good point. Mark, can you look into improving estimation practices?\n[01:10] Mark: Sure.\n[01:12] Emily: And I can draft a short update template for clients.\n[01:18] John: Sounds good."
