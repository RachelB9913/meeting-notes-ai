[00:00] Sarah (Product): Thanks everyone for joining. The goal today is to align on priorities for Q2.
[00:08] Tom (Engineering): From engineering side, the biggest risk is performance. We need at least two weeks to optimize before release.
[00:18] Maya (Design): I agree. Also, the onboarding flow still feels heavy. We should simplify it.
[00:28] Sarah (Product): Decision: For Q2, performance improvements are the top priority, followed by onboarding simplification.
[00:40] Tom (Engineering): Action item: I will prepare a performance optimization plan by next Wednesday.
[00:48] Maya (Design): Action item: I’ll propose a simplified onboarding flow by the end of the week.
[00:55] Sarah (Product): Great. Anything else?
[01:00] Tom (Engineering): No, that covers it.
