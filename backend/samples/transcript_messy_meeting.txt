[00:00] John: So yeah, let’s start… um, not sure if everyone saw the email.
[00:07] Emily: Which email?
[00:09] John: The one about the client feedback. Basically they weren’t happy with the last delivery.
[00:18] Mark: Was that because of the delay or the missing features?
[00:22] Emily: I think both. The timeline slipped and expectations weren’t clear.
[00:30] John: Right. So, we probably need to fix communication. And also review how we estimate timelines.
[00:42] Mark: Maybe we should add buffer time. We always underestimate.
[00:47] Emily: Agreed.
[00:50] John: Ok, so… yeah. Let’s do something about that.
[01:00] Mark: Should someone own this?
[01:03] John: Good point. Mark, can you look into improving estimation practices?
[01:10] Mark: Sure.
[01:12] Emily: And I can draft a short update template for clients.
[01:18] John: Sounds good.
